# Harvest: A Lattice Surgery Scheduler for Magic State Cultivation

Harvest is a comprehensive framework for scheduling and routing lattice surgery operations in fault-tolerant quantum computing. It provides efficient tools for managing magic state cultivation, circuit preprocessing, and resource optimization in quantum lattice architectures.

## Note

I'm currently working on it as part of my master thesis. The end date is mid of June, I hope to have a somewhat fully fledged implementation by then. I will add more decription from time to time. Message me if you want to discuss some design chocices.
